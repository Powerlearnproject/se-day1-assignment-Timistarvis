#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools used in developing and maintaining a high quality system software.
It's importance in the technology industry cannot be over emphasized because the creation of software apps has solved alot of peoples problem in the world ranging from; entertainment, communication, e-commerce, e-learning, healthcare and so on.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
(a) The first programming language was FORTRAN
(b) Software enginnering started as a discipline as early as 1960s
(c) Structured programming beagan in the 1970s and subsequently led to the rise in agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
(i) Requirements (ii) Design (iii) Implementation (iv) Testing (v) Deployment (vi) Maintenance
(i) Requirements: this means gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
(ii) Design: this is creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
(iii) Implementation: this is writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
(iv) Testing: this means conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
(v) Deployment: is releasing the software to users or customers.
(vi) maintenance: this is providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method: is the sequential approach with distinct phases e.g(requirements, design and implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
While Agile method: is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The function of a software developer is to write codes and implement software solutions.
A Quality Assurance engineer job is to ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
While a Project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development Environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes. e.g Visual studio code, Eclipse.
However, Version Control systems are software tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. e.g Github, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
(i) Change requirements (ii) Tight deadlines (iii) Technical Debt
However, strategies that can e implemented to overcome this challenges are; effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
(i) Unit testing: this is testing individual components or modules of software.
(ii) Integration Testing: this is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
(iii) System testing: this is testing the entire software as a whole.
(iv) Acceptance testing: this is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the users need, most especailly the quality.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt enginnering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
The importance of prompt engineering when interating with AI models helps prevent, inaccuracy, miscomuunication and overall helps the AI get an answer tailored to your request. Nevertheless, using the right prompts makes the AI to understand your request because you were specific and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
For example, If you ask AI " Tell me about Pepsi company. It will given a general answer.
However, if you ask it specifially, "Tell me the location of the headquarters of pepsi company and list their four popular products" you'll definitely get a more focused response.
The improved propmt is effective because it was clear, concise and more focused at the direction of my request rather than a vague question.
