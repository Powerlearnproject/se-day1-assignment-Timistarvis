Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools used in developing and maintaining a high quality system software.
It's importance in the technology industry cannot be over emphasized because the creation of software apps has solved alot of peoples problem in the world ranging from; entertainment, communication, e-commerce, e-learning, healthcare and so on.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
(a) The first programming language was FORTRAN
(b) Software enginnering started as a discipline as early as 1960s
(c) Structured programming beagan in the 1970s and subsequently led to the rise in agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
(i) Requirements (ii) Design (iii) Implementation (iv) Testing (v) Deployment
(vi) Maintenance
(i) Requirements: this means gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
(ii) Design: this is creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
(iii) Implementation: this is writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
(iv) Testing: this means conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
(v) Deployment: is releasing the software to users or customers.
(vi) maintenance: this is providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
